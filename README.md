# HadaForge

**HadaForge** is a modular AI-agent operating framework that empowers solopreneurs to build and manage intelligent agents like elite teammates â€” amplifying human potential through collaborative design, automation, and strategic clarity.

> Inspired by the folded patterns of *hada* steel and the art of *alchemy*, this project is where agents are forged to do work that transforms both people and outcomes.

## ðŸš€ Vision

HadaForge is designed for the long game:

- **Base Agent Kit**  
  A domain-agnostic, developer-friendly framework for defining, deploying, and evolving AI agents across use cases.

- **Class-A Agent Collaboration**  
  Each agent is treated like a high-performing hire: equipped with responsibilities, memory, tools, and the ability to collaborate.

- **Solopreneur-Ready**  
  Designed for founders, builders, and creators who want to multiply their capabilities â€” without scaling headcount.

- **Composable Architecture**  
  Agents, tools, memory, and workflows are fully modular and built for rapid iteration.
