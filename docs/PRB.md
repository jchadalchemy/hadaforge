### 🧱 Framework

* **Foundation:** Based on Archon (extending toward custom Base Agent Kit)
* **Core Modules:**

  * Agent loader
  * Memory management (local & Supabase)
  * Tool execution layer
  * Agent orchestration via MCP

### 🧰 Tools / Integrations

* **Cursor**: Development IDE in active use

### 🧪 Agents Deployed or Prototyped

### ⚙️ Architecture Goals

* Agent = specialist hire
* MCP = orchestrator of tasks and priorities
* Modular agent org: onboarding, delegation, reporting, memory sync
