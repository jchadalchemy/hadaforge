## 🔥 What is HadaForge?

**HadaForge** is the organizational forge at the heart of our solopreneur system — where agents are shaped like elite hires, roles are refined like layered steel, and collaboration between people and AI becomes an art of transformation.

> This is where people and agents are refined, empowered, and fused to create value that neither could achieve alone.

Inspired by the *hada* grain pattern of masterfully folded steel and driven by the spirit of *alchemy*, HadaForge is not just an AI operating system — it’s the crucible where possibility is transformed into performance.

## 🌐 Primary Goals

### 1. **The Base Agent Kit**

A fully flushed-out, domain-agnostic agent system — customizable for any problem space or venture.

* Framework based on (or inspired by) Archon
* Modular architecture
* Developer-friendly
* Configurable agents, memory, tools, and routing
* Long-term compatibility with both solo and team workflows

### 2. **Class-A Agent Collaboration**

Every agent is treated like a world-class specialist.

* Assigned roles and responsibilities
* Designed for collaboration with other agents and humans
* Aligned to amplify each other's strengths
* Built with empathy, precision, and performance in mind

> Together, agents + people = force multipliers.
